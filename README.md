Howdy!

Most of my current work and projects live in school servers so this account is going to look pretty inactive for the time being. But don't let the lack of nice green squares fool you! I am busting my hump daily on data analytics, data management, and other assorted IT & CS projects. I don't have much opportunity to make *meaningful* use of git at the moment and I'd rather have an honest display of my activity than script updates to look busy. 

Cheers!

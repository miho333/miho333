Howdy!

I'm a college student and currently most of my work and projects have to live in school cloud servers and classrooms for the time being. So this repo is going to look pretty inactive. But don't let the lack of nice green squares fool you! I am busting my hump daily learning data analytics, data management, and other necessary IT skills to eventually pivot my career into business intelligence. I'm happy to use Git but don't have much opportunity to make *meaningful* use of it at the moment and I'd rather have an honest display of my activity than script updates to look busy. 

Cheers!
